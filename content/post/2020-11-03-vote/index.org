* What's the Cause?
/Vote. It should be that simple, but the US is rather backwards when it comes to doing democracy. So we find a mess of different rules, lawsuits, deadlines, suppression efforts, and on and on. While the battle rages long before (and after) Election Day, on the actual day we can still do much to help./

* What Can We Do?
/First off, if you can and haven't, go vote! To quickly find out the info you need and the latest happenings for your area try *[[https://www.vote.org/][Vote.org]]*, *[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/how-to-vote/][The Washington Post guide]]*, or *[[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/][FiveThirtyEight]]*. If you can't vote, or already have, there's still a lot you can do, from reminding people to vote to sending food to long lines. Options below./

There's a lot to be said about this election in particular and the rather messed up way elections are run in the US. There will be more work to be done after, as voting is just one small step, but let's focus on what we can do /today/ to make this as easy and representative as possible.

Below are some links for information for yourself or to send to those that might need it, as well as helping get out the vote, get people to voting locations and being fed while stuck on long lines. Of course, now is a good time to make sure everyone you know has voted. And if you can't vote for whatever reason, remind those that can that they are also representing you. There's a lot at stake, just as much for those that can't vote whether too young, disenfranchised, or otherwise unable to.
